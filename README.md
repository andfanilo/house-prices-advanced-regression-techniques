# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) >=5.x

## API credentials

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on Windows in the location `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`).

For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-based systems you can do this with the following command:

`chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

# Installation guide

## Set up conda environment

Using conda:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
activate house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
```

The packages necessary to run the project are now installed inside the conda environment.

**Note: The following sections assume you are located in your conda environment.**

## Set up project's module

To move beyond notebook prototyping, all reusable code should go into the `src/` folder package. To use that package inside your project, install the project's module in editable mode, so you can edit files in the `src/` folder and use the modules inside your notebooks :

```
pip install --editable .
```

To use the module inside your notebooks, add `%autoreload` at the top of your notebook :

```
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

Example of module usage :

```py
from src.data.make_dataset import generate
generate(10)
```

# Invoke command

We use [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to manage an
unique entry point into all of the project tasks.

List of all tasks for project :

```
$ invoke -l

Available tasks:

  lab     Launch Jupyter lab
```

Help on a particular task :

```
$ invoke --help lab
Usage: inv[oke] [--core-opts] notebook [--options] [other tasks here ...]

Docstring:
  Launch Jupyter lab

Options:
  -i STRING, --ip=STRING   IP to listen on, defaults to *
  -p, --port               Port to listen on, defaults to 8888
```

You will find the definition of each task inside the `tasks.py` file, so you can add your own.

_PS : we don't use Makefile because some people work on Windows workstations and the
install of make is cumbersome on those._
